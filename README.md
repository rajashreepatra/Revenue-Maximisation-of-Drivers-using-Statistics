**1. Problem Statement**
Taxi booking is a fast-paced sector, so making the most out of revenue is essential for the long-term success of the drivers and their happiness. Therefore, our goal is to use data-driven insights to maximise revenue streams for taxi drivers in order to meet this need. Our research aims to determine whether payment methods have an impact on fare pricing by focusing on the relationship between payment type and fare amount.

**2. Research Question**
Is there a relationship between total fare amount and payment type?
Can customers be directed to make payment via a desired payment method that could geenrate higher revenue for drivers, without negatively impacting customer experience?

**3. Data Overview**
In this project, we have used the detailed dataset of NYC Taxi Trip records for the year 2020, and performed data cleaning and feature engineering procedures to concentrate solely on the relevant columns essential for our investigation.

**4. Methodology**
The steps used for this analysis are:
a. Descriptive Analysis - Performed statistical analysis to summarize key aspects of the data, focusing on fare amounts and payment types.
b. Hypothesis Testing - Conducted a T-test to evaluate the relationship between payment type and fare amount, testing the hypothesis that different payment methods influence fare amounts.

**Journey Insights**
* Customers paying with cards tend to have a slightly higher average trip distance and fare amount compared to those paying with cash.
* Indicates that customers prefers to pay more with cards when they have high fare amount and
long trip distance.

**Preference of Payment Types**
* The proportion of customers paying with cards is significantly higher than those paying with cash, with card payments accounting for 67.5% of all transactions compared to cash payments at
32.5%.
* This indicates a strong preference among customers for using card payments over cash, potentially due to convenience, security, or incentives offered for card transactions.

**Passenger Count Analysis**
* Among card payments, rides with a single passenger (passenger_count = 1) comprise the largest proportion, constituting 40.08% of all card transactions.
* Similarly, cash payments are predominantly associated with single-passenger rides, making up 20.04% of all cash transactions.
* There is a noticeable decrease in the percentage of transactions as the passenger count increases, suggesting that larger groups are less likely to use taxis or may opt for alternative payment methods.
* These insights emphasize the importance of considering both payment method and passenger count when analyzing transaction data, as they provide valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences.

  **6. Hypothesis Testing**
* Null hypothesis: There is no difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards
and customers who use cash.
* Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in average fare between customers who use credit
cards and customers who use cash.

With a T-statistic of 165.5 and a P-value of less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is indeed a significant difference in average fare between the two payment methods.

**7. Recommendations**
* Customers can be encouraged to pay with credit cards to capitalize on the potential for
generating more revenue for taxi cab drivers.
* Strategies such as offering incentives or discounts for credit card
transactions can be implemented to incentivize customers to choose this payment method.
* Provision of seamless and secure credit card payment options to enhance customer
convenience and encourage adoption of this preferred payment method.
